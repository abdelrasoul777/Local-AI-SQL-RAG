# Local-AI-SQL-RAG
a local, free, hybrid AI agent using DSPy and LangGraph to answer retail analytics questions. The agent must intelligently switch between or combine: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) over local Markdown documents. SQL Generation over a local SQLite database (Northwind). Core Constraint: No paid APIs or external network calls at inference.
